##  Project Overview

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, which serves as a central showcase for my skills, completed projects, and certifications.

The site is structured to demonstrate **professional development standards**, including:
* **Clean Architecture:** Strict adherence to best practices for file organization and separation of concerns.
* **Case Consistency:** All file and folder names are kept in lowercase to prevent common deployment errors on case-sensitive servers (like GitHub Pages).
* **Foundational Skills:** Proficiency in core web technologies and version control.

## Technology Stack

This website is built entirely on the foundational languages of the web:

* **HTML5:** Used for the semantic structure and content organization.
* **CSS3:** Used for styling, responsive layout, and visual presentation.
* **Internal JavaScript:** (If you have any inline or internal scripts for things like navigation toggles or basic interactivity, mention it here. If not, you can remove this bullet point.)

## Repository Structure

The project follows a standard, organized web directory structure for optimal clarity and navigation:

| Directory/File | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`index.html`** | The main landing page and entry point for the entire website. |
| **`pages/`** | Contains all secondary HTML pages (`about.html`, `skills.html`, etc.) for clean navigation. |
| **`images/`** | Stores all media assets for the portfolio (profile photo, skill icons, logos). |
| **`certificates/`** | Stores the actual proof documents (`cert1.png`, etc.) displayed on the certificate page. |
| **`Projects/`** | Houses the source code folders for all showcased individual projects. |
| **`README.md`** | This documentation file. |

The `Projects/` folder is divided into specialized directories:

* **`indulge-web-project/`**: Contains the code for my multi-page web design project, which demonstrates HTML and CSS proficiency.
