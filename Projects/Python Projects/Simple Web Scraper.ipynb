    "# Simple Web Scraper: Fetching News Headlines\n",
    "\n",
    "This project demonstrates basic web scraping techniques using Python's popular libraries, **requests** and **BeautifulSoup**. The goal is to extract real-time headlines from a target news website.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Concepts Demonstrated:\n",
    "* **HTTP Requests:** Using the `requests` library to fetch HTML content.\n",
    "* **HTML Parsing:** Utilizing `BeautifulSoup` to navigate and search the DOM structure.\n",
    "* **Error Handling:** Implementing `try...except` and `response.raise_for_status()` for robust network error management.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### ⚠️ Ethical Note on Scraping\n",
    "Always check a website's `robots.txt` file (e.g., `https://www.news24.com/robots.txt`) before scraping. Excessive requests can burden a server, and violating terms of service may lead to legal issues. This script is intended for educational purposes only."
